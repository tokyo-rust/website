about_us = """\
Tokyo Rust is a non-profit organization dedicated to the success of the Rust programming language in Japan.

We believe that Rust is a perfect match for Japanese engineering values such as diligence, risk management, and coordinated effort. Japan is also a leader in industries such as infrastructure, mobility, and robotics, that benefit the most from Rust's capabilities.

We facilitate the adoption of Rust in Japan by building a support network for Rustaceans, fostering public discourse around the language, and demonstrating its natural fit for Japan's key industries.
