# Code of Conduct

## Introduction

TokyoRust.org (hereafter, "TokyoRust") provides events open to participants from various regions and communities. We believe it is essential that all participants feel welcome, safe, and secure, and have an enjoyable time at our events.

This Code of Conduct has been established with that sentiment in mind, and it outlines the standards of behavior expected of all event participants. It applies to all events planned and operated by TokyoRust.

Please note that if an individual event has its own specific code of conduct, it will apply in conjunction with this Code of Conduct.

## Code of Conduct

TokyoRust requests that all event participants (including but not limited to speakers, staff, and attendees) adhere to this Code of Conduct. Please be aware that this Code of Conduct may be updated from time to time.

Each event has its own distinct purpose. We ask that you refrain from any behavior that is inconsistent with the theme and objective of the event.

We do not tolerate harassment in any form, whether intentional or unintentional. This includes, but is not limited to, presentations and talks at events, interactions at social gatherings, and comments on Twitter or other online media. If you are asked to stop any harassing behavior, you are expected to cease immediately.

Harassment includes, but is not limited to: offensive comments related to gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, age, or religion; intimidation; stalking; sustained disruption of events; and other forms of unwelcome conduct.

All participants must refrain from disruptive speech or actions, or any other behavior that interferes with the event itself or with other participants. Furthermore, do not bring any items that are prohibited by law or dangerous items that could cause harm or fear to other participants.

If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact a nearby event staff member immediately. When you contact us, please rest assured that we will handle your personal information, including your name, anonymously and in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations, including the Act on the Protection of Personal Information.

## Enforcement for Violations

If a participant engages in behavior that violates this Code of Conduct, TokyoRust will immediately request that the behavior cease. Depending on the circumstances, we may take appropriate action, including revoking the individual's permission to attend the event. In such cases, you must comply with the instructions of the event staff without delay. Please note that no refunds of event participation fees or other costs will be made in the case of a violation of the Code of Conduct.
